# Facial-Expression-Recognition

We have trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify Facial Expressions. 

Model Design:

**Total params:** 5,396,103

**Trainable params:** 5,392,647

**Non-trainable params:** 3,456

The types of expressions are:

1. 'sad'
2. 'disgusted'
3. 'happy' 
4. 'angry'
5. 'surprised'
6. 'fearful'
7. 'neutral'

We have used the Facial-Expression-Recognition 2013 Dataset to train our model.

We have achieved an accuracy of **61.54%** and **61.74%** on validation set and test set respectively.
